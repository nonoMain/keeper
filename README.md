# How to use?

# What can be backed up?
Everything! I use it to back up an entire template home
directories for quickly setting up a user when going onto a new machine
including wallpapers and programs preferences.
It comes with a few templates so you can use them or learn
from them how to create your own.

# Why?
I made this script for backing up configuration files
when moving between files or creating templates for certain
types of machines

# Features
- [ ] different archive types
- [ ] edit the content when restoring a backup according to the new user
- [ ] test if a certain archive is valid
- [ ] choose the archive profile at the run of the script
